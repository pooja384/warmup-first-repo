1. Understand Git & Version Management
      -:Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in code and help multiple developers work on the same project without conflicts.
                 It maintains a complete history of changes and supports collaboration through local and remote workflows
    Git Basics:
     Staging: Selecting specific file changes using git add before saving them.

     Commit: Saving a snapshot of staged changes with a message to track progress.

     Push: Uploading local commits to a remote repository (GitHub/GitLab).

     Pull: Downloading and integrating the latest changes from a remote repository.

     Merge: Combining changes from one branch into another.
   
   Branching Strategy:
     main: Stable, production-ready code.

     dev: Active development and testing branch.

     feature/*: Used for developing individual features separately.
